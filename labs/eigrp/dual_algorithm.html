            <h1>DUAL Algorithm</h1>
            <div class="content-card">
                <p>The Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) is the core of EIGRP's rapid convergence and loop-free operation. DUAL ensures that all routes calculated are loop-free and allows for quick re-convergence when a primary path fails.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts in DUAL:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Feasible Distance (FD):</strong> The best metric from the local router to the destination network. This is the metric of the successor route.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertised Distance (AD) / Reported Distance (RD):</strong> The metric advertised by a neighbor to reach a destination network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Successor:</strong> The next-hop router for the best path to a destination. The successor route is stored in the routing table.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feasible Successor (FS):</strong> A backup path to a destination that is guaranteed to be loop-free. A neighbor can be a feasible successor if its Advertised Distance to the destination is less than the local router's Feasible Distance to the same destination.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DUAL Operation:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Passive State:</strong> When a router has a stable route (successor) and potentially a feasible successor, it is in a passive state for that route.</li>
                    <li><strong>Active State:</strong> If the successor route fails and there is no feasible successor available, the router enters an active state for that route. It sends queries to its neighbors to find a new path.</li>
                    <li><strong>Queries and Replies:</strong> Neighbors respond to queries with their best paths to the destination. If a neighbor doesn't have a path, it queries its own neighbors. This diffusion process continues until a new path is found or it's determined that the network is unreachable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Convergence:</strong> Once a new path is found (either directly or through a query/reply process), the router updates its routing table and returns to a passive state.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The ability of DUAL to pre-calculate backup paths (feasible successors) significantly reduces convergence time, as the router doesn't need to re-calculate a path from scratch when the primary path fails.</p>
