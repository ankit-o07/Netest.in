            <h3 id="step1">Step 1: Grasp the Basics of IP Addresses</h3>
            <p>An IP address is like a digital mailing address, uniquely identifying devices on a network. IPv4, the most common version, uses a 32-bit address written as four octets separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.10). Each octet ranges from 0 to 255, representing 8 bits. The address splits into two parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Portion:</strong> Identifies the network a device belongs to.</li>
                <li><strong>Host Portion:</strong> Specifies the individual device within that network.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, in 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24), the first three octets (192.168.1) denote the network, and the last octet (10) identifies the host. Understanding this structure is crucial before diving into subnetting.</p>

            <p><em>Diagram illustrating the network and host portions of an IPv4 address.</em></p>
            <p>IPv4 addresses are categorized into classes (A, B, C, etc.), but subnetting often focuses on Class C (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) for smaller networks. Familiarity with binary (e.g., 192 = 11000000) helps, as subnetting relies on bit-level manipulation.</p>

            <h3 id="step2">Step 2: Understand the Subnet Mask</h3>
            <p>The subnet mask defines which part of an IP address is the network portion and which is the host portion. It’s expressed in dotted-decimal (e.g., 255.255.255.0) or CIDR notation (e.g., /24, indicating 24 network bits). In binary, a subnet mask uses 1s for network bits and 0s for host bits.</p>
            <p>Common subnet masks include:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Subnet Mask</th>
                    <th>CIDR</th>
                    <th>Total Addresses</th>
                    <th>Use Case</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>255.0.0.0</td>
                    <td>/8</td>
                    <td>16,777,216</td>
                    <td>Large enterprise networks</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>255.255.0.0</td>
                    <td>/16</td>
                    <td>65,536</td>
                    <td>Medium-sized networks</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>255.255.255.0</td>
                    <td>/24</td>
                    <td>256</td>
                    <td>Small office networks</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>255.255.255.252</td>
                    <td>/30</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>Point-to-point links</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>For instance, 255.255.255.0 (/24) in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000, meaning the first 24 bits are network bits, leaving 8 bits for hosts. Subnetting involves “borrowing” host bits to create smaller networks.</p>

            <h3 id="step3">Step 3: Determine Subnet and Host Requirements</h3>
            <p>Before subnetting, identify how many subnets and hosts per subnet your network needs. Each subnet requires two reserved addresses: one for the network itself and one for broadcasts. Thus, the usable host addresses are total addresses minus two.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a 192.168.1.0/24 network (256 addresses), if you need four subnets, each gets 256 ÷ 4 = 64 addresses. Subtracting the network and broadcast addresses, each subnet supports 62 usable hosts.</p>
            <p>To calculate subnets, use the formula 2ⁿ, where n is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion. For four subnets, borrow 2 bits (2² = 4). The new subnet mask becomes /26 (24 + 2 = 26 bits), with 64 addresses per subnet.</p>

            <h3 id="step4">Step 4: Perform Subnet Calculations</h3>
            <p>Subnetting requires dividing the IP address range into smaller segments. Let’s subnet 192.168.1.0/24 into four subnets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Current Subnet Mask:</strong> /24 = 255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000.</li>
                <li><strong>Borrow Bits:</strong> To create four subnets, borrow 2 bits, making the new mask /26 = 255.255.255.192 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate Address Ranges:</strong> Each subnet has 64 addresses (256 ÷ 4). The ranges are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0–192.168.1.63 (Usable: 192.168.1.1–192.168.1.62)</li>
                        <li>Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64–192.168.1.127 (Usable: 192.168.1.65–192.168.1.126)</li>
                        <li>Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128–192.168.1.191 (Usable: 192.168.1.129–192.168.1.190)</li>
                        <li>Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192–192.168.1.255 (Usable: 192.168.1.193–192.168.1.254)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Quick Tip:</strong> Use a subnet calculator for speed, but manual calculations are vital for certifications like CCNA. To verify, convert the last octet to binary and increment by the block size (64 in this case).</p>

            <h3 id="step5">Step 5: Implement Subnetting in Practice</h3>
            <p>Subnetting has practical applications across various scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Office Networks:</strong> Separate departments (e.g., HR, IT, Sales) into subnets to enhance security and reduce broadcast traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Centers:</strong> Allocate subnets for servers, storage, and management networks to optimize resource usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Home Networks:</strong> Create a guest Wi-Fi subnet to isolate guest devices from your main network.</li>
           視点: Subnetting has practical applications across various scenarios:

- **Office Networks:** Separate departments (e.g., HR, IT, Sales) into subnets to enhance security and reduce broadcast traffic.
- **Data Centers:** Allocate subnets for servers, storage, and management networks to optimize resource usage.
- **Home Networks:** Create a guest Wi-Fi subnet to isolate guest devices from your main network.

<p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> A small business with 60 employees needs three subnets: one for 40 workstations, one for 10 guest devices, and one for 5 servers. Using 192.168.1.0/24, you can create three /26 subnets (64 addresses each), assigning:</p>
<ul>
    <li>192.168.1.0/26 for workstations (62 usable hosts).</li>
    <li>192.168.1.64/26 for guests (62 usable hosts).</li>
    <li>192.168.1.128/26 for servers (62 usable hosts).</li>
</ul>
<p>Configure these subnets on your router or switch (e.g., Cisco IOS) using VLANs or interface settings. For example:</p>
<pre>
interface FastEthernet0/0.1
 encapsulation dot1Q 10
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192
</pre>
<p>This sets up the first subnet on a Cisco router.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips for Mastering Subnetting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Practice with Tools:</strong> Use Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3 to simulate subnetted networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Memorize Key Masks:</strong> Know common masks like /24 (255.255.255.0) and /30 (255.255.255.252).</li>
    <li><strong>Learn Binary Conversion:</strong> Practice converting octets to binary (e.g., 192 = 1100005940) for manual calculations.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Subnet Calculators:</strong> Tools like SolarWinds Subnet Calculator can save time for complex networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Test Your Knowledge:</strong> Try online subnetting quizzes or Cisco’s CCNA practice exams to build confidence.</li>
</ul>
